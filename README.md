MoneyTree is a decentralized bank on Avalanche. It gives out zero-interest loans for AVAX er holders. The loans are paid out as stablecoins called USDR.

USDR Benefits People

USDR makes it possible for people to store value in decentralized money that:
•	Unlike current fiat money has zero inflation
•	Unlike current crypto-assets has no price fall risk in bear market

USDR Benefits AVAX  Holders

USDR makes it possible for AVAX  holders to receive zero interest loans with no due time in order to deal with their expenses without spending their AVAX .
In addition, the use of AVAX to secure loans not only increases demand but also decreases the supply of AVAX, resulting in a significant increase in price.

MoneyTree as a Lending Platform

The current decentralized loan solutions like SALT, Nexo, or MakerDAO require 2.5% to 22% interest, stability fee, liquidation penalty, etc. MoneyTree however, does not require any kind of interest, fee, or penalty whatsoever. There’s also no due time for paying back the loans in MoneyTree as long as enough collateral has been locked as collateral.
